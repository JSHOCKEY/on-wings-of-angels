                    <p>— Lisa A. Gentry on December 22, 2025</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>On the Wings of Angels is an unforgettable, soul-stirring journey that left me deeply moved and
                    profoundly grateful to have found it. This book is a testament to the power of a mother's
                    love—unyielding, sacrificial, and fiercely committed. It's the kind of story that wraps itself
                    around your heart and lingers long after the final page.</p>

                    <p>— Steven J. Sternberg on January 3, 2026</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>The details that were provided by Mr. Sytnyk of his experience during his early life in the
                    horrific environment of World War II were very insightful, emotional and ultimately overwhelming.
                    Through his faith in God and the fundamental goodness of people, he was able to make it through.</p>

                    <p>— WBB on December 30, 2025</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Very easy for anyone to read and enjoy. This is an amazing TRUE story that inspires one's own
                    FAITH. An unexpected life adventure reminding us of our human capacity for horror but more
                    importantly goodness.</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>This is an amazing story of hope, love, resilience, and faith. That anyone could endure such
                    heartache and hardships from such an early age and still have a positive outlook on life is

                  </div>
                  <p>A moving piece of reality in a time period that overall we are failing to teach. In a time where
                    words like "Nazi," "Death Camps," "Gestapo," "Hitler," and "Socialism" are used as casual
                    adjectives, we need to take the time to realize the meaning of these words.</p>
